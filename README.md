# Autonomous Mobile Robot for Wetlands Monitoring
 Code for the control of the WetMobile including Navigation, localization, object recognition and Sampling Tasks Execution

The project WetGuard aims to monitor the greenhouse gases emissions in wetlands. An autonomous mobile robot is developed to automize the sampling process which requires carrying two heavy sensors and placing a chamber in the ground in multiple points every 2 hours, even in difficult weather conditons.
